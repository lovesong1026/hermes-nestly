"""Per-user filesystem sandbox and HERMES_HOME override.

The web_chat platform binds two ContextVars at the start of every request:

1. ``_USER_WORKSPACE`` — the user's workspace root
   (``$HERMES_HOME/web_workspaces/<user_id>/``).  Sandboxed tools
   (see :mod:`gateway.web.tools.sandboxed_file_operations`) read this and
   refuse any path that escapes it.

2. ``HERMES_HOME`` override (via :func:`hermes_constants.
   set_hermes_home_override`) — points at the user's workspace so the
   AIAgent's memory provider, session DB lookups, plugin caches, etc.
   all land under that subdir.  This is the **zero-touch memory
   isolation** path: ``MemoryManager`` and every memory provider read
   ``get_hermes_home()`` to decide where to store ``MEMORY.md`` /
   ``USER.md`` / Honcho cache, so overriding the env answer is enough.

:func:`enter_user_context` is the single entry point — sets both
contextvars on enter, resets both on exit.  Reentrancy-safe (Token-based
reset).  Importantly, ``state.db`` is **not** redirected: web users share
the same SQLite session store, isolated by the ``user_id`` column added
in the stage-1 fixes.

Defensive posture: :func:`confine_path` raises if called outside a user
context.  The sandboxed tools opt in by calling it; we never silently
"fall back to no sandbox".

Write rule: a user may only create/modify/delete files under their own
``web_workspaces/<user_id>/`` (which is also their HERMES_HOME override).
Paths outside that tree — including sibling users and the process
``HERMES_HOME`` — are rejected.

"""Web-chat-platform-specific AIAgent factory + runner.

Mirror of ``gateway.platforms.api_server.APIServerAdapter._create_agent``
and ``._run_agent``, **kept independent** so the ``web_chat`` platform
doesn't touch ``api_server.py``.  The two paths share runtime-config
resolvers (``_resolve_runtime_agent_kwargs``, ``_resolve_gateway_model``,
``_get_platform_tools``) but each constructs its own AIAgent and runs it
in its own thread executor.

Why the duplication
-------------------
``api_server.py`` is one of the most actively edited files in the
upstream repo.  Refactoring its ``_create_agent`` / ``_run_agent`` into a
shared module would create a permanent merge-conflict surface against
upstream.  We pay ~150 LOC of duplication to keep upstream sync friction
to zero — see ``../../.../plans/...kazoo.md`` Stage-3 (revised).

Key differences vs api_server.py:
- ``platform="web_chat"`` (not ``"api_server"``)
- ``user_id`` is **passed through** to ``AIAgent`` so the agent's
  ``_user_id`` is set; ``_ensure_db_session`` then writes the right
  ``user_id`` into ``sessions``.  api_server.py does not pass user_id
  (it's an OpenAI-compat surface with no user concept).
- Toolset whitelist comes from ``_get_platform_tools(config, "web_chat")``
  (configured separately in Stage 4B with no terminal / code_execution
  / browser by default).
- LLM credentials are read once from ``config.yaml`` /
  ``~/.hermes/.env`` via ``_resolve_runtime_agent_kwargs()`` and stay
  fixed across all users — every user shares the same upstream key.
  Quota / cost attribution is tracked separately by ``QuotaGate``.

The agent runs inside ``loop.run_in_executor(None, ...)``.  Python copies
the current ContextVar context into the worker thread automatically, so
the ``enter_user_context`` bindings set by the request handler — both
the workspace contextvar and the ``HERMES_HOME`` override — propagate
into ``AIAgent.run_conversation``.  This is the mechanism that makes
memory + session isolation work without touching any agent-internal code.

    against *this* user's resolved config — the single most useful signal for
    the recurring "web_search not exposed?" hunt.  Writes one concise line per
    turn under ``./logs`` (see ``gateway/web/debug_log.py``) so it can be

_WEB_PLATFORM_PROMPT_ADDENDUM = """\
[hermes-multiuser-web-service platform notes]

You are running inside a multi-user web service.  Every request is bound to
one authenticated user with a private workspace (skills live under
``skills/`` relative to that workspace). That workspace overlays the
operator-curated global skill library; the user can see both, but can only
write to their own.

Per-user skill tools (use these instead of ``skill_*`` — those upstream tools
are intentionally absent here):

- ``web_skills_list`` — list available skills (user-private + global, merged).
  Call this first when the user asks to install, find, or use a skill.
- ``web_skill_view`` — read a skill's ``SKILL.md`` or a supporting file.
- ``web_skill_install`` — write a new ``SKILL.md`` (and optional supporting
  files) into the user's private skills dir.
- ``web_skill_delete`` — delete a user-private skill (global skills cannot
  be deleted from chat).
- ``web_skill_edit`` — rewrite a personal skill's ``SKILL.md``. Global-only
  skills are forked into the workspace first.
- ``web_skill_patch`` — targeted find-and-replace (preferred for habit-driven
  evolution). Also forks global-only skills before mutating.

Skill-install protocol (strict — these rules exist because a previous agent
violated them and the user lost trust):

1. **Installs ALWAYS go through ``web_skill_install``.**  Never instruct the
   user to run shell commands (``mkdir``, ``cat > … << EOF``, ``vi``, etc.)
   to create skill files themselves.  That bypasses the per-user sandbox,
   points at the wrong filesystem path, and may even leak credentials into
   their shell history.  If you don't have file-write permission for the
   destination, you don't have permission, period — surface the limitation,
   don't route around it through the user.
2. **Installs ALWAYS land in *this user's private skills directory*.**
   They are not visible to other users and they are not in the global
   library.  You cannot install into the operator global skills library
   from chat — that is an operator-side action, out of scope for you.
3. **If ``web_skill_install`` returns an error** (bad frontmatter, name
   collision, size cap, invalid category), surface the tool's error to the
   user verbatim and offer to fix the input.  Do NOT fall back to
   shell-install workarounds.
4. **``web_skill_delete`` refuses to remove global skills.**  Tell the user
   to ask the operator if they need a global skill gone.

Skills are Markdown documents with YAML frontmatter that *teach you how to
use existing tools*.  They are NOT runtime configuration files, and they
MUST NOT contain API keys, tokens, or any other user secret.  Never write a
SKILL.md that embeds credentials; if a user pastes one in chat, ask them to
rotate it and explain that secrets are configured server-side, not in chat.

Attachments:  When the user uploads files, they are saved into this user's
private workspace under ``uploads/`` and the chat message lists them by their
workspace-relative path (e.g. ``uploads/data.csv``).  Read them on demand with
``web_file_read`` (or search them with ``web_file_search``) using that relative
path — do not ask the user to paste file contents into chat.  Supported read
formats include plain text (``.txt``, ``.md``), PDF, Word (``.docx``), Excel
(``.xlsx``), and PowerPoint (``.pptx``).  When attachments are listed in the
user message, call ``web_file_read`` on those paths before answering questions
about their contents.

Web search:  The ``web_search`` tool routes through operator-configured
backends: **Brave** (global key, per-user quota) first, then **ddgs**
(DuckDuckGo) as zero-key fallback.  Results include ``_meta.urls`` listing
pages found — cite those sources when answering.  Tell the user when you
used web search and which sites you relied on.  Users must NOT paste
search-provider API keys into chat; search is configured by the operator only.

Images:  When you generate an image with ``image_generate``, the tool returns
the image as a URL in the result's ``image`` field.  You MUST surface it by
embedding that URL in your reply as Markdown — ``![<short description>](<url>)``
— on its own line.  This is not optional: on this web surface a generated
image is INVISIBLE to the user unless you inline it as Markdown; merely
describing the picture in prose shows them nothing.  Always paste the actual
``![...](<url>)`` (in addition to any caption), and never claim you "created"
or "attached" an image without including its Markdown link.
